# Ruff_Rogue

## Type of game
Our team OP decited that our game will be 2D platformer from side-view with spark of rogue-like gameplayer.

## Game engine
For our game we'll use Godot. Why we choose to use Godot, it's really simple, it's because Godot is free to use.

## Art program
We'll be using paint.net, same reason as why Godot.

## Reasons & Expectations
We know it will not easy, but if you trust us and we'll our-selfs as well it's doable,
as Shia LeBeouf said "just do it! make your dreams come true." and we will deliver it.
And why we making a game? It's easy to explain. Every single guy what to own something and we want our own game!
We are heavily by Rogue Legacy, Binding of Issac and Cult of Lamb.

### PS
We hope you'll follow us on our road throughout this and though our spaghetti code.
See yall soon!
