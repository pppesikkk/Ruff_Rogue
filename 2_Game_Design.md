# Game Design

##High-level concept

Genre: 2D action-platformer roguelite with procedural castles (rooms/biomes), permadeath per run, and meta-progression between runs (heir system + upgrades).

Tone: Challenging, fast-paced, with short runs and long-term growth.

Hook: Each death spawns an heir with one or more randomized traits (positive/negative) that affect gameplay and flavor text.

##Status effects

Poison (tick dmg/sec), Burn, Freeze (slow), Stun (time), Knockback (force).


##Rules

Permadeath removes current character, but gold and certain upgrades are kept.

Heirs: get 1–3 traits (see sample list) that modify attributes or add mechanics.

Items: equipment slots (weapon, armor, accessory1, accessory2). Some items are temporary (found in run); others are relics (persist).
