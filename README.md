## Introduction
Hello we are The OP-Team in composition of Ondřej Pešan and Oleksii Prosvirnov.
We are just young lads from IT school located in Varnsdorf.

## Name of the Game
We chose name Ruff Rogue because we want it to be tough, challenging and
our playable character will be animals so that's why *Ruff*,
and *Rogue* because it's rogue-like.
